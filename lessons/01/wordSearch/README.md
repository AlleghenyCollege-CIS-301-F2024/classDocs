# Activity (ungraded)

Working with a partner to determine origins of data.

## Date

30 August 2024

There are five files in the Directory `data/` which were generated from five diverse articles. Each file contains a two columns; a list of words and their counts taken from an original article. We note that for a word to appear in the list, it must have had at least two occurrences in the article.

An example of the data is shown below; words are on the left and their corresponding counts from an article appear on the right.

| Word  | Count |
| :---------: | :---- |
| flower     | 6 |
| water      | 9 |
| sunshine   | 4 |

## What to do?

Work with your group or partner. Your task is to use only the lists of words and their counts to form an argument about the subject matter of each file. While you may not know the exact nature of the article, your task is to try to form an argument for the type and subject of article.

Discuss your ideas with your group. We will discuss group conclusions as a class.
